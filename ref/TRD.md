## 6. Security Requirements

### 6.1 Authentication
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing (if applicable)

### 6.2 Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement principle of least privilege

### 6.3 Data Protection
- Encryption for data in transit (HTTPS)
- Encryption for sensitive data at rest

## 7. Performance Requirements

### 7.1 Load Handling
- Support for up to 10,000 concurrent users
- Efficient database queries and indexing

### 7.2 Response Time
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Page load time < 3 seconds on 3G connections

## 8. Scalability

### 8.1 Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design for easy scaling
- Implement caching mechanisms (Redis or similar)

### 8.2 Database Scaling
- Implement database sharding if necessary
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization

## 9. Localization

### 9.1 Multi-language Support
- Implement i18n for Indonesian and English languages
- Design for easy addition of new languages

## 10. Testing Requirements

- Postman collection for API testing and documentation

## 13. Compliance and Standards

### 13.1 Web Standards
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for accessibility
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation

### 13.2 Code Quality
- Enforce ESLint and Prettier for code style consistency
- Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions

## 14. Future Considerations

### 14.1 Extensibility
- Design for easy addition of new features and modules
- Implement plugin architecture for custom extensions

### 14.2 AI Integration
- Prepare for potential integration of AI for predictive analytics
- Design data structures to support machine learning models
